# Benchmarking Tutorial for COCO Segmentation and Detection

This folder contains scripts, utilities, and documentation for benchmarking object detection and segmentation models using datasets in the COCO format. It is designed to help you prepare your data, integrate your models, and evaluate their performance using standard COCO metrics.

## Folder Structure

- **benchmark.ipynb**: Example notebook for running benchmarks and visualizing results.
- **object_detection.ipynb** / **segmentation.ipynb**: Notebooks for object detection and segmentation tasks.
- **MODEL_INTEGRATION.md**: Guide for integrating your own segmentation model and preparing outputs for COCO evaluation.
- **ADD_SEGMENTATION.md**: Explains how to add segmentation masks to your COCO dataset using the provided script.
- **add_segmentation.py**: Script to add segmentation mask information to your COCO dataset annotations.
- **add_is_crowd.py**: Utility to add or update the `iscrowd` field in COCO annotations.
- **evaluate.py**: Script for evaluating model predictions against COCO ground truth.
- **segmentation_dataset.py** / **object_detection_dataset.py**: Dataset utilities for segmentation and detection tasks.
- **dummy_segmentation_model.py** / **dummy_model.py**: Example models for testing the pipeline.
- **data_utils.py**: Helper functions for data loading and processing.
- **data/**: Contains your dataset(s) in COCO format. Typically includes:
  - Unzipped dataset folder(s) (e.g., `20250507_NORD_FKB_Som_Korrigert/`)
  - Zipped dataset archives for storage or sharing
- **env/**: Python virtual environment for package management (optional, not required if you use your own environment).

## Getting Started

1. **Prepare your dataset** in COCO format and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. (If needed) **Add segmentation masks** to your dataset using `add_segmentation.py` (see `ADD_SEGMENTATION.md`).
3. **Integrate your model** following the instructions in `MODEL_INTEGRATION.md`.
4. **Run the notebooks** or scripts to benchmark and evaluate your model.

## Documentation
- See `MODEL_INTEGRATION.md` for model integration and output formatting.
- See `ADD_SEGMENTATION.md` for details on adding segmentation data to your dataset.

## Notes
- The provided scripts and notebooks are examples and may require adaptation for your specific dataset or model.
- The `env/` directory is a local Python virtual environment (optional).
